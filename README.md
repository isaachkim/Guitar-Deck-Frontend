## Hurdles

- Reactronica is the new technology that was implemented into this site. It was challenging to figure out a way to connect Reactronica with my backend.

- The pathing for the audio files for the Reactronica was challenging in terms of finding the correct location and the correct folder to store them in.

- Bootstrap was used for the navbar and it was difficult to customize the navbar to my preferences.
